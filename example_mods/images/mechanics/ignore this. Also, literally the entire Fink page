Physical Appearance
Fink is a short, green, humanoid rat. She has lime green fur and long messy mint green hair. She has small ears and a long tail coming from her dress. Her sclera are light red, and she has two eyelashes on each eye. She also has a notable sharp, snaggle tooth on the right side of her mouth. She wears a white lab coat with a skirt, a pair of magenta gloves, and dark gray boots, and a light grey Turbo Collar. She has a stubby small black nose with a very thin black tail as well.

In "Boxman Crashes", her irises are shown as red, however in "K.O. vs. Fink" her irises are shown to be yellow. Whether or not it was because she was turbo in "K.O. vs. Fink", a design change, or an animation error is currently unknown.

Personality
Fink is a young rat with an aggressive attitude as she tends to rough up anyone in her way and insults anyone. She also enjoys mayhem and destruction. Much like her master, Professor Venomous, she enjoys fighting heroes. She is also very attached to her boss, almost like a parental relationship. It is revealed in "Villains' Night In" that this is because he treats her well, giving her praise and gifts much like she is his own child. She mentions that she is his favorite minion.

She does not get along well with the robots of Boxmore, as she is very free-spirited and malicious, and doesn't want to play by their rules. She also bullied K.O. for being a mommy’s boy.

Aside from her malicious nature, her personality is comparable to that of a young child. This is made clear in "Villains' Night In" when after falling asleep, she is cradled in Professor Venomous' arms, and he mentions her previous babysitters. Despite this, she has apparently driven a car before (although not without disturbing the general peace).

Initially, she disliked Lord Boxman and acted hostile to him, doing things such as calling him names and biting him. However, in "Boxman Crashes", she warms up to him after he builds her a large, destructive tricycle, even calling him "Box-Boss" and asking him to make her another.

In spite of her belligerence, "K.O. vs. Fink" reveals that she is emotionally neglected due to Professor Venomous’ negligence because of his heavy workload and Shadowy's interference, as well as being belittled by Darrell and Shannon frequently, hence explaining her hostility which is stemmed from her insecurity and that she couldn't do anything about Venomous' "Shadowy" situation.

She shows extreme remorse and hatred towards Shadowy Figure, for alienating her from Venomous when he takes over his body, and as a result for threatening her led her on playing games obsessively. The montage near the end of "Thank You For Watching the Show" reveals that, because of her obsessive video game playing, she becomes a very popular professional e-sports player.
