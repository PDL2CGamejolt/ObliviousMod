So youre probably wondering how you do cool shit with this

In Scripts:
First thing you need to do is load the script, use the event or copy this into the script: 
function onCreate()
    addLuaScript('SimpleModchartTemplate')
end

Make sure you actually have the template in your mods folder lol


look at the modifier List text file, basically when the modchart template is loaded, it creates lua sprites with the same names as
the modifiers, and all you need to do is tween/change the position of them, none of the sprites are loaded btw, dont worry about that
note that the z pos is over the angle, so to tween the z pos, use doTweenAngle()



tween examples: 
doTweenY('rev', 'reverse', 1, stepCrochet/1000, 'quantInOut')	flips scroll

setProperty('scale.x', 2)					scale up and tween back down
doTweenX('scalex', 'scale', 0.7, stepCrochet/500, 'cubeInOut')

setProperty('drunk.x', 0.5)					set drunk with no tween
setProperty('drunkSpeed.x', 250)

setProperty('drunk.angle', 4)					set drunk z and tween back down
setProperty('drunkSpeed.angle', 6)
doTweenAngle('t', 'drunk', 0, stepCrochet/250, 'quantInOut')

setProperty('confusion', 360)					note spin
doTweenAngle('confusion', 'confusion', 0, stepCrochet/500, 'cubeInOut')


use stepHit or something to put these in
btw if youre wondering what stepCrochet is, its the time between steps, stepCrochet/1000 = time between steps in seconds
its used for making stuff on beat and whatever

In Events:
First thing is to use the event to load the script, you can place it anywhere doesnt have to be at the start

This is simlar to the script explaination, the modifier list text file tells you which ones are available

examples:

event =   "easeModifierY"	flips scroll
value 1 = "reverse,1"		takes 3 seconds and eases with quantInOut
value 2 = "3,quantInOut"

event =   "easeModifierZ"	tweens tipsy z to 3
value 1 = "tipsy,3"		takes 3 seconds and eases with elasticInOut
value 2 = "3,elasticInOut"

event =   "invert"		notes move left/right to swap positions
value 1 = "1"			takes 1 seconds and eases with cubeInOut
value 2 = "cubeInOut"
