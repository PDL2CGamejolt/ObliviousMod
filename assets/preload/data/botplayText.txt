The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
There's really no hard limit to how long these botplay texts can be and to be quite honest I'm rather curious to see how far we can go. Adolphus W. Green (1844–1917) started as the Principal of the Groton School in 1864. By 1865, he became second assistant librarian at the New York Mercantile Library; from 1867 to 1869, he was promoted to full librarian. From 1869 to 1873, he worked for Evarts, Southmayd & Choate, a law firm co-founded by William M. Evarts, Charles Ferdinand Southmayd and Joseph Hodges Choate. He was admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1873. Anyway, how's your day been? Also, this text was copied exactly from Cookie Clicker's achievement with nearly the exact same text, with the only change being that I replaced "achievement names" with "botplay texts"! DOH! Why am I still making this longer?! OK just restart the song please so this botplay text can finally end, okay? Thanks! - Jordan Santiago
Why don't you play DDR instead? You'll finally get some exercise in.

In YouTube's sixth April Fools' prank, YouTube joined forces with The Onion, a newspaper satire company, by claiming that it will "no longer accept new entries". YouTube began the process of selecting a winner on April 1, 2013, and would delete everything else. YouTube would go back online in 2023 to post the winning video and nothing else. After that, on April 1, 2013, YouTube briefly repeated the "YouTube Collection" joke from April 1, 2012. They also broadcast a live ceremony in which two "submission coordinators" continuously read off the titles and descriptions of random videos (the "nominees") for twelve straight hours, claiming they would do hold the same ceremony every day for the next two years.

Dude, turning on BOTPLAY is such a coward way to win a song. See, you didn't even win it, you just cheated! You never, ever win and no one likes you. Go get your father back you fat b*tch. Results: I won, you lost, you suck, no one likes you, now cry about it because you can't play anymore noob little baby there is one way to legitimately play lol get mad keep crying b*tch
Actually, "they" is a gender-neutral pronoun. You used THEIR, you accidental ally! LGBT is not overused. Also, LGBT people CAN be Christian, and I'm one. Being religious is no excuse for being homophobic. What if you die and you get sent down THERE because of your raging homophobia?
you ARE the idiot. and besides are you that person who used BOTPLAY? if yes then get lost loser
